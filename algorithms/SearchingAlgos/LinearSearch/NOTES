Linear Search: Essentially starts from thebeginning (or even end) of an array/string and checks all the elements one by one until a match is found

PSEUDOCODE:
    - This function accepts an array and value 
    - Loop through the array and check id the current array element is equal to the value 
    - If it is return the index at which the element is found 
    - If the value is never found return - 1
